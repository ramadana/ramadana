# Hi, There

My name is Rama, Pramandha Arthadana. I'm a Software Engineer, living in Surabaya, Indonesia. I love to code, especially when creating something great together. I’ve been on companies with on-site or remote workers. These past years, almost all of the companies I joined employ me as a remote worker.

My main skill and experience are in iOS App development, with almost 9 professional year on it, starting from 2012. I also have around 2 years of professional experience in ReactJS for developing web applications and Golang for backend API servers. Aside from that, I also give consultation to my clients if they need it, about what products should they build and what technologies used to build them.

I'm interested and looking forward to building next great system or apps. Especially when it will be used by many people. I’ve been build or help companies buld system and apps that being used by people across Indonesia. Some of them are: Jawa Pos, Paxel, Amartha, Samurai Festival, and Samurai Reward System.

# Things I Do

- 📱 Vacuum since end of 2021, but my heart and enthusiasm still reside in developing **iOS** applications. Hopefully Apple notice this, and accept me as one of their employee 😂
- ⚛️ Today, more **ReactJS** jobs comes to me. Ranging from simple landing page, to complex CRM and ERP system.
- 🛠️ Mainly I use **UIKit** when building iOS apps. But, in 2021 I also use **************SwiftUI************** on one of my projects.
- 🏗️ ********MVC******** or **************MVVM************** and their variants, are my preferred architectures when building mobile apps.
- 🧰 ******************Alamofire******************, ******************************DZNEmptyDataSet******************************, **********************SwiftyJSON**********************, ********************Kingfisher********************, ******SwiftyUtils******, ********Spring******** and ************Lottie************ are some of my main libraries when building iOS apps.
- ⚙️ ******************OneSignal******************, ****************Firebase****************, ****************Facebook**************** and ********************Midtrans******************** (payment gateway in Indonesia) are some of the SDKs that I use for my projects.
- 🤖 I rarely code **Android** and **Flutter** apps. But, I still can take the job. I can plan, code, and debug it if needed.
- ⭐ **Fastlane** is also present my toolbox. One of my primary tools for getting my team ahead from other coworkers and competitors.
- 📦 I use ********TestFlight********, ****DeployGate****, **********Diawi**********, **************************************************Firebase App Distribution************************************************** (my favourite) as my beta app distribution platforms.
- 🚢 I am familiar with CI/CD process, especially for mobile apps. I’ve used **Bitrise**, **Nevercode**, **CircleCI** and **TravisCI**. But, **Bitrise** shine above them all for mobile apps CI/CD 🚀.
- 🛎️ Yes, I also built my own CI/CD system using **************Jenkins************** and ****************Fastlane****************. Mostly, for building and deploying mobile apps.
- ⚡ I am using **Go Fiber** for building backend (REST API) server. Its speed, efficiency and ease of use has helped me overcome many challenges in building backend server.

- ☸ Still mastering on **Docker Swarm** and **Kubernetes**. I am also learning to integrate **KrakenD** into my existing tech stacks.
- ☁️ Mainly, I use **Linode** and ****************DigitalOcean**************** to deploy my projects. Sometimes, I also deploy to ******AWS****** if my clients prefer on using it.
- 🔥 **Firebase** platform is used on most of my projects. **Cloud Firestore**, **Cloud Function**, **Hosting**, **Crashlytics**, **Analytics**, **App Messaging**, and **Remote Config** services are often integrated into my projects.

- 🐞 I am using **************Sentry************** and **************Firebase Crashlytics************** to monitor errors and bugs on my projects.

- 🚃 I am used to work with teams remotely. So I am familiar and comfortable with most online meeting and collaboration tools.
- 🍿 But, if possible. I also love and shedule (If I manage the team) to have meetup on weekly or monthly basis. Real face to face conversation really is required to have proper bonding between teammates.
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Going out with my family on the weekend. A week would not be whole without this.
