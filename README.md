Hello, My name is Pramandha Arthadana. 
Or you can just call me Rama, hence @ramadana.

I'm a Software Engineer, currently living in Indonesia's City of Heroes (Surabaya). My main skills are in iOS apps development. I have around 9 years of professional experience in it. I also have some experience in Android and Flutter apps development. In addition to that, I also have around 2 years of professional experience in ReactJS for developing web applications and backend servers.

Today, I'm still learning iOS (yes, I still have a lot to catch up on and try). I'm also further learning about Flutter and ReactJS. In addition to that I also try to make some time to learn further about Golang, MongoDB, and Kubernetes.

I'm interested and looking forward to building a system or application that will be used by many people. Over my working years, I've helped build some apps that have also been used by many people. Paxel, Amartha, and oNE Mobile are some of them. You can check my portfolio [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1tkimsqv30blf85/Resume%20-%20Pramandha%20Arthadana.pdf?dl=0).

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you want to collaborate with me or if you want to offer me some engineering jobs. You can contact me via email or via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rmdn/) messenger. Let's connect!
